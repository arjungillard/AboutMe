I am the Founder of AG Talent.

Are you a tech professional struggling to hire or looking for your next challenge?
 
You need a recruiter that you can trust.
 
One that you can partner with, who listens, is efficient and cares.
 
That’s where I come in.
 
I am a tech recruiter with over 12 years of experience. I pride myself on having a consultative approach.
 
You can ensure your brand is represented correctly throughout the recruitment process.
 
I’ve scaled global tech teams across the UK, EU and US, including easyJet, Truelayer, S&P Global and Genius Sports. I have also partnered successfully with Startups, Scale-ups and SMEs.

Let me help you scale by finding your team exceptional talent.
